## What is all this?
This "programming assignment" is really just a way to get you used to
some of the tools we use every day at Pantheon to help with our research.

There are 4 fundamental areas that this small task will have you cover:

1. Getting familiar with training models using [pytorch-lightning](https://pytorch-lightning.readthedocs.io/en/latest/starter/new-project.html)

2. Using the [Hydra](https://hydra.cc/) framework

3. Logging and reporting your experiments on [weights and biases](https://wandb.ai/site)

4. Showing some basic machine learning knowledge

## What's the task?
The actual machine learning task you'll be doing is fairly simple! 
You will be using a very simple GAN to generate fake
[MNIST](https://pytorch.org/vision/stable/datasets.html#mnist) images.

We don't excpect you to have access to any GPU's. As mentioned earlier this is just a task
to get you familiar with the tools listed above, but don't hesitate to improve the model
as much as you can!

## What you need to do

To understand how this framework works have a look at `src/train.py`. 
Hydra first tries to initialise various pytorch lightning components: 
the trainer, model, datamodule, callbacks and the logger.

To make the model train you will need to do a few things:

- [ ] Complete the model yaml config (`model/mnist_gan_model.yaml`)
- [ ] Complete the implementation of the model's `step` method
- [ ] Implement logging functionality to view loss curves 
and predicted samples during training, using the pytorch lightning
callback method `on_epoch_end` (use [wandb](https://wandb.ai/site)!) 
- [ ] Answer some questions about the code (see the bottom of this README)

**All implementation tasks in the code are marked with** `TODO`

Don't feel limited to these tasks above! Feel free to improve on various parts of the model

For example, training the model for around 20 epochs will give you results like this:

![example_train](./images/example_train.png)

## Getting started
After cloning this repo, install dependencies
```yaml
# [OPTIONAL] create conda environment
conda create --name pantheon-py38 python=3.8
conda activate pantheon-py38

# install requirements
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Train model with experiment configuration
```yaml
# default
python run.py experiment=train_mnist_gan.yaml

# train on CPU
python run.py experiment=train_mnist_gan.yaml trainer.gpus=0

# train on GPU
python run.py experiment=train_mnist_gan.yaml trainer.gpus=1
```

You can override any parameter from command line like this
```yaml
python run.py experiment=train_mnist_gan.yaml trainer.max_epochs=20 datamodule.batch_size=32
```

The current state of the code will fail at
`src/models/mnist_gan_model.py, line 29, in configure_optimizers`
This is because the generator and discriminator are currently assigned `null`
in `model/mnist_gan_model.yaml`. This is your first task in the "What you need to do" 
section.

## Open-Ended tasks (Bonus for junior candidates, expected for senior candidates)

Staying within the given Hydra - Pytorch-lightning - Wandb framework, show off your skills and creativity by extending the existing model, or even setting up a new one with completely different training goals/strategy. Here are a few potential ideas:

- **Implement your own networks**: you are free to choose what you deem most appropriate, but we recommend using CNN and their variants if you are keeping the image-based GANs as the model to train
- **Use a more complex dataset**: ideally introducing color, and higher resolution
- **Introduce new losses, or different training regimens**
- **Add more plugins/dependecy**: on top of the provided framework
- **Train a completely different model**: this may be especially relevant to you if your existing expertise is not centered in image-based GANs. You may want to re-create a toy sample related to your past research. Do remember to still use the provided framework.

## Questions

Try to prepare some short answers to the following questions below for discussion in the interview.

* What is the role of the discriminator in a GAN model? Use this project's discriminator as an example.

* The generator network in this code base takes two arguments: `noise` and `labels`.
What are these inputs and how could they be used at inference time to generate an image of the number 5?

* What steps are needed to deploy a model into production?

* If you wanted to train with multiple GPUs, 
what can you do in pytorch lightning to make sure data is allocated to the correct GPU? 

## Submission

- Using git, keep the existing git history and add your code contribution on top of it. Follow git best practices as you see fit. We appreciate readability in the commits
- Add a section at the top of this README, containing your answers to the questions, as well as the output `wandb` graphs and images resulting from your training run. You are also invited to talk about difficulties you encountered and how you overcame them
- Link to your git repository in your email reply and share it with us/make it public
